# ACL-A1-CYBR
File System Access Control (ACL) Assignment for CYBR-3-7-1. Created a "clinic" and wrote scripts to create directories and manage permissions

Objectives
The learning objectives for the assignments are:
1. Be able to analyse an information system and identify its resources and components.
2. Analyse a case study and identify relevant access control needs.
3. Implementing the policy using appropriate access control systems.
Although we will be focusing on the (L)UNIX file system, what you learn here will also be applicable to the
Windows operating system.

Case study:
You are the system administrator working at WClinic and responsible for setting up the security
controls to manage access for staff.

System overview
WClinic is system comprised of a set of files, directory structures, executable scripts and access
control lists while ensuring proper access control. WClinic uses files to store all information rather
than the popular relational databases. This provides simplicity in design while ensuring all (most of!) access
control requirements are met.
